This whole thing needs a rewrite its a gosh darn mess. Im learning pygame now so next version is goin to have 'graphics', pixelart if your good.



# Text_Based_Game_V0.2
(I named this repository badly)
Store Update!
This is the store update. Now the game actually does something.

As with the description on Main.py, all the files need to be in the same directory and you run the Main.py file.

The config files are there to edit the game content. I suggest starting with Locations_Config.txt and changing the name and number of locations you would like 
in your game. For the rest of your config files, I would suggest that the number of shops (Shop_Names_Config.txt) is at least double the number of locations 
and that it is a multiple of the number of locations (makes the number of shops in each area equal eg. if you have 5 locations, try for ten shops.), next the 
number of food items in those shops (Food_Items_Config.txt) is three of four times the length of the number of shops, and a multiple of the number of shops (I 
have a thing for the number five so i went with that in the defaults, eg. five towns, ten shops, fourty food items (capital letter food items are special)), 
next precious items (can you guess it?), (Precious_Items_Config.txt) are just really expensive so i went with ten (one per shop), finnaly 
tools (Tool_Items_Config.txt) is less open to be messed with. In game these items are really expensive and sell for a lot but your inventory will want you to 
equip th, no matter what they are. Here will lie the hardcoded content of the future updates.You can kinda ignore any of the Name.Temp.py files as these are 
written on the fly when the game starts (unless there is a new one but I'm pretty sure the program will make onr if it is not currently around).

I am currently using this project to teach myself how to code in python. If you have comments or critiques then ... I don't actually know if this website 
does comments or something but whatever the equivalent would be, feel free to do that.

The origonal idea for this game came from a badly remebered idea about an old text based game (ZORG or something) and that one of my python classes taught me 
about reading and writing to other files. Poof, fully configable game appears. As in the TODO's in Main.py, I will be updating this as new features roll out(and 
manually fixing that repository name (Wait could I write a program for that?)).
